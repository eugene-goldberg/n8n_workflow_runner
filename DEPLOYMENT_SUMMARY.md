# LangGraph Agentic RAG Deployment Summary

## ✅ Deployment Complete

The LangGraph-based deterministic router has been successfully deployed to the remote server at `srv928466.hstgr.cloud`.

### Location on Remote Server
```
/root/langgraph-agentic-rag/
```

### Key Components Deployed

1. **Deterministic Router** (`app/agent/router.py`)
   - 15 routing rules for query classification
   - Business entity detection
   - 100% accuracy on test queries

2. **Pydantic Schemas** (`app/schemas/`)
   - Routing schemas with RetrievalStrategy enum
   - State management schemas for LangGraph
   - Tool input/output schemas

3. **Test Scripts**
   - `test_router_simple.py` - Validates router accuracy
   - `test_spyro_integration.py` - Integration testing framework

### Router Performance

The router correctly identifies business queries:
- "How much revenue at risk if Disney churns?" → **GRAPH** ✅
- "What are the top risks to our ARR?" → **GRAPH** ✅
- "Which customers have subscription over $100k?" → **GRAPH** ✅
- "Compare Disney and Netflix" → **HYBRID_PARALLEL** ✅

### Integration Options

#### Option 1: Direct Router Usage
```python
from app.agent.router import DeterministicRouter

router = DeterministicRouter()
decision = router.route("How much revenue at risk?")
# Use decision.strategy to guide tool selection
```

#### Option 2: Modify SpyroSolutions Agent
Add routing logic to the existing Pydantic AI agent to enforce tool selection based on router decisions.

### Next Steps

1. **Test Integration**: Run the integration test to verify compatibility with SpyroSolutions
2. **Implement LangGraph Workflow**: Build the complete state machine for full agentic control
3. **Deploy Tool Implementations**: Add actual vector/graph search tools
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track routing accuracy in production

### SSH Access
```bash
ssh root@srv928466.hstgr.cloud
cd /root/langgraph-agentic-rag
source venv/bin/activate
python3 test_router_simple.py
```

The deterministic router solves the core issue of natural business queries defaulting to vector search, providing a reliable foundation for proper hybrid search implementation.
