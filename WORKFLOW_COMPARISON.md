# n8n Workflow Comparison Guide

This guide helps you choose the right workflow for your use case.

## Workflow Overview

| Workflow | Purpose | AI Required | Complexity | Best For |
|----------|---------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Basic Chat | Testing infrastructure | No | Low | Development/Testing |
| AI Integration | Simple AI responses | Yes (OpenAI) | Medium | General chatbot |
| Intent Evaluation | Intent classification only | Yes (OpenAI) | Medium | Understanding requests |
| Intent Routing | Full routing system | Yes (OpenAI) | High | Production systems |

## Detailed Comparison

### 1. Basic Chat Workflow
**File**: `n8n-ai-chat-workflow-working.json`

**Features**:
- Simulated responses (no AI)
- Quick setup
- No API costs

**Use When**:
- Testing WebSocket connections
- Debugging callback flow
- Developing frontend

**Limitations**:
- No real AI responses
- Fixed response patterns

### 2. AI Integration Workflow
**File**: `n8n-ai-chat-workflow-with-agent.json`

**Features**:
- Real AI responses via OpenAI
- Configurable models
- Simple request/response flow

**Use When**:
- Building a general-purpose chatbot
- Need AI responses without routing
- Single-purpose assistant

**Limitations**:
- No intent classification
- No specialized handling

### 3. Intent Evaluation Workflow
**File**: `n8n-intent-evaluation-fixed.json`

**Features**:
- LangChain agent for intent analysis
- Structured JSON output
- Confidence scoring

**Use When**:
- Need to understand user intent
- Building analytics/insights
- Preparing for routing (but not implementing it)

**Output Example**:
```json
{
  "intent": "TECHNICAL_SUPPORT",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "entities": ["login", "password"],
  "urgency": "HIGH",
  "suggestedAction": "Reset password"
}
```

### 4. Intent-Based Routing Workflow
**File**: `n8n-intent-routing-workflow.json`

**Features**:
- Complete routing system
- 6 specialized handlers
- Priority escalation
- Expression-based routing

**Use When**:
- Production customer service
- Multi-department organizations
- Need different handling per intent
- Require SLA-based escalation

**Routing Map**:
- Technical Support → Tech team
- Billing Questions → Finance
- Feature Requests → Product team
- Complaints → Customer service
- General Inquiries → General support
- Urgent Complaints → Executive escalation

## Decision Tree

```
Need AI responses?
├─ No → Basic Chat Workflow
└─ Yes → Need intent classification?
         ├─ No → AI Integration Workflow
         └─ Yes → Need routing?
                  ├─ No → Intent Evaluation Workflow
                  └─ Yes → Intent Routing Workflow
```

## Migration Path

1. **Start with**: Basic Chat (test infrastructure)
2. **Add AI**: AI Integration (get AI responses working)
3. **Add Intent**: Intent Evaluation (understand requests)
4. **Add Routing**: Intent Routing (full production system)

## Performance Considerations

| Workflow | Response Time | API Calls | Cost |
|----------|--------------|-----------|------|
| Basic Chat | ~100ms | 0 | Free |
| AI Integration | ~2-3s | 1 | Low |
| Intent Evaluation | ~2-3s | 1 | Low |
| Intent Routing | ~3-4s | 1 | Low |

## Customization Difficulty

1. **Basic Chat**: ⭐ (Very Easy)
   - Just modify response arrays

2. **AI Integration**: ⭐⭐ (Easy)
   - Change system prompts
   - Adjust models

3. **Intent Evaluation**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Moderate)
   - Modify intent categories
   - Adjust output format

4. **Intent Routing**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Advanced)
   - Add new routes
   - Modify escalation logic
   - Integrate with external systems

## Recommendations

### For Startups
Start with **AI Integration**, then upgrade to **Intent Routing** as you grow.

### For Enterprises
Go directly to **Intent Routing** for comprehensive handling.

### For Developers
Use **Basic Chat** for development, test with **Intent Evaluation**.

### For Support Teams
**Intent Routing** provides the best customer experience with proper escalation.
