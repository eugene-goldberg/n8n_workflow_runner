# n8n Workflow Status - AI Agent with Tools and Memory

## Current Date: July 29, 2025

## Overview
We have successfully implemented an AI agent workflow in n8n that demonstrates both tool usage (Knowledge Base search) and persistent memory using PostgreSQL. However, there are ongoing challenges with follow-up detection.

## What's Working

### 1. Tool Integration ✅
- **Knowledge Base Search Tool** is fully functional
- AI agent successfully calls the tool for technical support queries
- Returns relevant solutions from the KB (e.g., password reset instructions)
- Tool output is properly formatted and integrated into responses

### 2. Basic Memory Storage ✅
- PostgreSQL container is deployed and running (`n8n_postgres_memory`)
- Conversation history IS being stored in the `chat_sessions` table
- We can query and see the stored messages with proper formatting

### 3. Production Webhook ✅
- FastAPI backend updated to use production webhook URL
- File: `main_with_websocket.py` (not `main.py`)
- URL: `https://n8n.srv928466.hstgr.cloud/webhook/ai-chat-webhook`
- Web app connects reliably without manual workflow triggering

### 4. Memory Retrieval (Partial) ⚠️
- We can manually verify that previous conversations exist in PostgreSQL
- Example: "What is my name?" correctly returns "Eugene" from history

## What's NOT Working

### 1. Automatic Follow-up Detection ❌
- Despite messages containing "still" (clear follow-up indicator), `isFollowUp` remains `false`
- The AI agent doesn't automatically recognize continued conversations
- Related tickets array remains empty even for obvious follow-ups

### 2. Memory Integration Architecture Issues ❌
- Original setup: Direct connection from Postgres Chat Memory to AI Agent didn't inject history
- Current setup: Added Chat Memory Manager nodes but still having issues
- The AI Agent sees only the current message, not the conversation history

## Current Workflow Architecture

```
Webhook → Process Message → Chat Memory Insert → Chat Memory Retrieve → AI Agent → Prepare for Routing
                                    ↓                    ↓
                            Postgres Chat Memory ←-------┘
```

### Key Nodes:
1. **Postgres Chat Memory**: Stores conversations per user session
2. **Chat Memory Insert**: Stores incoming messages (newly added)
3. **Chat Memory Retrieve**: Retrieves conversation history
4. **AI Agent**: Processes with tools and (should have) memory context

## Current Issues Being Debugged

### 1. Session Key Error
- Postgres Chat Memory showing "Key parameter is empty" error
- Need to set: `{{ $json.user_id }}` in Session Key field
- This is preventing proper memory operations

### 2. Memory Write/Read Loop
- Initially only had read operations, no write
- Added Chat Memory Insert to store messages
- Need second insert after AI Agent for AI responses
- Complete loop not yet functional

### 3. System Prompt Configuration
- Added explicit follow-up detection rules
- Added debug instructions to show what history AI sees
- Still not detecting follow-ups properly

## PostgreSQL Details

### Connection:
- Host: `172.18.0.4` (Docker network)
- Database: `chat_memory`
- User: `n8n_memory`
- Table: `chat_sessions`

### Data Format:
```json
{
  "type": "human|ai",
  "content": "message text",
  "additional_kwargs": {},
  "response_metadata": {}
}
```

## Recent Discoveries

1. **n8n Version Issues**: Current n8n UI doesn't show "Agent Type" selector that documentation references
2. **Memory Node Limitations**: Known issues in 2025 with Postgres Chat Memory not properly injecting context
3. **Workflow Structure**: Need both read and write operations for complete memory functionality

## Next Steps (When Resuming)

1. **Fix Session Key Error**: Set `{{ $json.user_id }}` in Postgres Chat Memory node
2. **Complete Memory Loop**: Add second Chat Memory Insert after AI Agent
3. **Test Follow-up Detection**: Clear DB, run fresh test with two messages
4. **Alternative Approach**: If still failing, implement manual PostgreSQL query node

## Test Commands for Verification

```bash
# Check PostgreSQL data
docker exec -it n8n_postgres_memory psql -U n8n_memory -d chat_memory -c "SELECT * FROM chat_sessions WHERE session_id = 'test-user' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 4;"

# Test follow-up detection
curl -X POST https://n8n.srv928466.hstgr.cloud/webhook/ai-chat-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "test-user", "message": "I cannot login", "correlation_id": "test-001"}'

curl -X POST https://n8n.srv928466.hstgr.cloud/webhook/ai-chat-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "test-user", "message": "I am still unable to login", "correlation_id": "test-002"}'
```

## Files Modified
- `/Users/eugene/dev/apps/n8n_workflow_runner/fastapi-react-app/backend/main_with_websocket.py`
- `/Users/eugene/dev/apps/n8n_workflow_runner/postgres-docker-compose.yml`
- Various workflow JSON files in `Workflows/` directory

## Documentation Created
- `TOOL_WORKFLOW_README.md` - Complete guide for tool integration
- `MEMORY_WORKFLOW_README.md` - Memory implementation guide
- `MEMORY_WORKFLOW_PLAN.md` - Original implementation plan

## Current Blockers
1. Session key configuration error in Postgres Chat Memory
2. AI Agent not receiving conversation history despite memory being stored
3. Follow-up detection logic not working even with explicit instructions

## Success Criteria for Completion
- [ ] User says "I cannot login" → KB solution provided
- [ ] User says "still not working" → Recognized as follow-up
- [ ] `isFollowUp: true` in response
- [ ] Previous ticket referenced in `relatedTickets`
- [ ] Context from first message shown in second response
