# Graph RAG Implementation Verification: PostgreSQL + Apache AGE + pgvector in n8n

## Research Findings

### 1. PostgreSQL + pgvector in n8n ✅ VERIFIED

**Native Support Confirmed:**
- n8n has built-in `PGVector Vector Store` node
- Part of n8n's LangChain integration
- Actively used by the community for RAG implementations
- Multiple usage patterns available:
  - Direct node usage for document operations
  - AI Agent tool integration
  - Vector Store Retriever pattern
  - Question Answer Tool pattern

**Community Evidence:**
- Active discussions about RAG with Postgres
- Users successfully implementing PostgreSQL pgvector workflows
- Advanced RAG setups with contextual summaries and reranking

### 2. Apache AGE + PostgreSQL ⚠️ NO DIRECT n8n INTEGRATION

**Current Status:**
- Apache AGE is a valid PostgreSQL extension for graph database functionality
- Supports Cypher query language within PostgreSQL
- No dedicated n8n node for Apache AGE
- No community examples found combining n8n + Apache AGE

**Technical Details:**
- Apache AGE queries must be wrapped in SQL:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
    MATCH (n:Node) RETURN n
  $$) AS (node agtype);
  ```
- Could theoretically work through n8n's PostgreSQL node
- Would require manual query construction

### 3. Combined Implementation Challenges

**Verified Issues:**
1. **No Native Graph Support**: n8n's PostgreSQL node is designed for relational queries, not graph operations
2. **Complex Query Syntax**: Apache AGE requires specific SQL wrapper syntax that may be cumbersome in n8n workflows
3. **No Community Precedent**: No examples found of successful Apache AGE + n8n implementations
4. **Data Type Handling**: Apache AGE uses custom `agtype` which may complicate n8n data processing

## Recommended Alternative Approaches

### Option 1: PostgreSQL + pgvector Only (Simplest)
- Use PostgreSQL for relational data
- Use pgvector for embeddings and similarity search
- Implement graph-like relationships using traditional SQL joins
- **Pros**: Full n8n support, proven community implementations
- **Cons**: Limited graph capabilities

### Option 2: Neo4j Community Node
- Install `n8n-nodes-neo4j` package
- True graph database with Cypher support
- Vector search capabilities included
- **Pros**: Proper graph database, community node available
- **Cons**: Requires separate database, additional setup

### Option 3: External Graph Service
- Use HTTP Request nodes to connect to:
  - Neo4j Aura (cloud)
  - Amazon Neptune
  - Azure Cosmos DB (Gremlin API)
- **Pros**: Professional graph capabilities
- **Cons**: External dependency, potential latency

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach (Recommended for SpyroSolutions)
```yaml
Architecture:
  - PostgreSQL + pgvector: For embeddings and RAG
  - JSON columns: Store graph-like relationships
  - Custom Functions: Implement graph traversal logic
  - n8n Function Nodes: Process graph queries
```

## Implementation Recommendation

For the SpyroSolutions project, I recommend:

1. **Use PostgreSQL + pgvector** for vector storage and RAG capabilities (proven n8n support)
2. **Model graph relationships** using:
   - JSONB columns for flexible entity properties
   - Junction tables for relationships
   - Recursive CTEs for graph traversal
3. **Implement graph logic** in n8n using:
   - Function nodes for complex queries
   - Code nodes for graph algorithms
   - Multiple PostgreSQL queries for traversal

## Example Implementation Pattern

```javascript
// n8n Function Node for graph-like query
const entityQuery = `
  WITH RECURSIVE graph_traversal AS (
    -- Base case: find customer
    SELECT id, properties, 'customer' as type
    FROM entities
    WHERE type = 'customer' AND properties->>'name' = $1
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case: follow relationships
    SELECT e.id, e.properties, r.type
    FROM graph_traversal g
    JOIN relationships r ON g.id = r.source_id
    JOIN entities e ON r.target_id = e.id
  )
  SELECT * FROM graph_traversal;
`;

// Use with n8n PostgreSQL node
return {
  query: entityQuery,
  params: ['EA']
};
```

## Conclusion

While Apache AGE is a powerful graph extension for PostgreSQL, it lacks direct n8n integration. The most practical approach for SpyroSolutions is to use PostgreSQL + pgvector with graph-like modeling techniques, leveraging n8n's proven PostgreSQL and PGVector nodes. This provides a balance between functionality and implementation complexity while maintaining full n8n support.
