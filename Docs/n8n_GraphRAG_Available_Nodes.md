# n8n Nodes Available for Graph RAG Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the currently available n8n nodes and integration options for implementing a Graph RAG system as of 2025.

## 1. Native n8n LangChain Nodes

### Vector Store Nodes (Built-in)
- **PGVector Vector Store** - PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- **Qdrant Vector Store** - Qdrant vector database
- **Pinecone Vector Store** - Cloud-based vector search
- **Simple Vector Store** - In-memory vector storage
- **Supabase Vector Store** - Supabase with pgvector

### Key Update (January 2025)
- n8n 1.74.0 introduced the ability to use Vector Stores directly as tools for AI agents
- This is a game-changer for RAG implementations

## 2. Graph Database Integration Options

### Neo4j Integration
- **Community Node**: `n8n-nodes-neo4j` (npm package)
  - Provides Neo4j database connectivity
  - Supports LangChain integration
  - Includes vector search capabilities
  - GitHub: https://github.com/ruapho/n8n_neo4j

### PostgreSQL with Apache AGE
- Use standard PostgreSQL nodes with Apache AGE extension
- Supports Cypher query language
- Can combine relational and graph data
- No dedicated node yet - use PostgreSQL node with custom queries

### InfraNodus GraphRAG
- **Integration Method**: HTTP Request nodes
- **Features**:
  - Knowledge graph visualization
  - Context-aware retrieval
  - Holistic document understanding
  - Relations between document chunks
- **Workflow Template**: "AI Chatbot Agent with Panel of Experts using InfraNodus GraphRAG"

## 3. Implementation Approaches for SpyroSolutions

### Option 1: PostgreSQL + pgvector + Apache AGE (Recommended)
```yaml
Nodes Required:
- PostgreSQL (for graph operations via Apache AGE)
- PGVector Vector Store (for embeddings)
- OpenAI Chat Model
- Agent node (for orchestration)
- Custom Function nodes (for graph queries)
```

**Advantages**:
- Single database for all data
- Native n8n support
- Cost-effective
- Good performance

### Option 2: Neo4j + Community Node
```yaml
Nodes Required:
- n8n-nodes-neo4j (install via npm)
- OpenAI Embeddings
- OpenAI Chat Model
- Agent node
- HTTP Request (for complex queries)
```

**Advantages**:
- True graph database
- Better graph algorithms
- Cypher query language
- Active community node

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
```yaml
Nodes Required:
- PostgreSQL (for relational data)
- PGVector Vector Store (for RAG)
- HTTP Request (for external graph service)
- InfraNodus integration (for graph visualization)
```

## 4. Custom Node Development

For advanced Graph RAG features not available in existing nodes:

### LangChain Code Node
- Import custom LangChain functionality
- Implement graph algorithms
- Create custom retrievers

### Function Nodes
- Write JavaScript/Python for graph operations
- Process complex queries
- Handle multi-hop traversals

### HTTP Request Nodes
- Connect to external graph databases
- Query RDF triple stores
- SPARQL endpoints

## 5. Workflow Patterns for Graph RAG

### Pattern 1: Entity Extraction & Linking
```
1. Document Loader → 
2. Entity Extractor (OpenAI) → 
3. Relationship Detector → 
4. Graph Database Insert
```

### Pattern 2: Query Processing
```
1. Chat Trigger → 
2. Query Parser (LLM) → 
3. Graph Query Builder → 
4. Multi-source Retrieval → 
5. Response Generation
```

### Pattern 3: Continuous Monitoring
```
1. Schedule Trigger → 
2. Graph Query (check metrics) → 
3. Threshold Evaluator → 
4. Alert Generator
```

## 6. Recommended Stack for SpyroSolutions

Based on available nodes and requirements:

1. **Database**: PostgreSQL with Apache AGE + pgvector
2. **Vector Store**: PGVector Vector Store node
3. **LLM**: OpenAI Chat Model node
4. **Graph Operations**: 
   - PostgreSQL node with Cypher queries
   - Custom Function nodes for complex logic
5. **Monitoring**: Schedule triggers + PostgreSQL queries
6. **UI**: n8n Chat Interface

## 7. Community Resources

- **n8n Community Forum**: Active discussions on RAG implementations
- **GitHub**: Custom nodes and workflow examples
- **Templates**: 
  - "Building the Ultimate RAG setup"
  - "Custom Knowledge RAG Chatbot"
  - "AI Agent with GraphRAG Knowledge"

## 8. Limitations & Workarounds

### Current Limitations:
- No native RDF/SPARQL support
- Limited graph visualization in n8n
- No built-in graph algorithms

### Workarounds:
- Use HTTP Request for external graph services
- Implement algorithms in Function nodes
- Leverage LangChain's graph capabilities
- Use external visualization tools

## 9. Future Considerations

- Official Neo4j node is under community discussion
- Graph database support is growing
- More LangChain graph features being added
- Community nodes continuously improving

## Conclusion

While n8n doesn't have native graph database nodes (except through PostgreSQL), the combination of vector stores, LangChain integration, and community nodes provides sufficient capabilities for implementing a Graph RAG system. The PostgreSQL + Apache AGE approach offers the best balance of features, performance, and native n8n support for the SpyroSolutions project.
