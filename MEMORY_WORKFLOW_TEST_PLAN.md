# Memory-Enhanced Workflow Test Plan

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive test scenarios and procedures for validating the memory-enhanced intent routing workflow.

## Test Setup

### Prerequisites
1. n8n instance running with OpenAI credentials configured
2. FastAPI backend running on http://172.17.0.1:8000
3. Memory workflow imported and activated
4. Test user IDs: `test-user-1`, `test-user-2`, `test-user-3`

### Test Data Structure
```json
{
  "correlation_id": "test-{timestamp}",
  "user_id": "test-user-{number}",
  "message": "{test message}",
  "callback_url": "http://172.17.0.1:8000/api/n8n-callback"
}
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Memory Retention
**Objective**: Verify that the system remembers previous conversations

**Test Steps**:
1. Send initial message:
   ```json
   {
     "user_id": "test-user-1",
     "message": "I can't log into my account"
   }
   ```
   Expected: TECHNICAL_SUPPORT intent, creates ticket TECH-XXX

2. Send follow-up message (within 5 minutes):
   ```json
   {
     "user_id": "test-user-1",
     "message": "It's still not working"
   }
   ```
   Expected: 
   - TECHNICAL_SUPPORT intent
   - `isFollowUp`: true
   - `contextFromHistory`: "Previous login issue reported"
   - `relatedTickets`: ["TECH-XXX"]

**Success Criteria**:
- System recognizes the follow-up
- Previous ticket is referenced
- Context is maintained

### Scenario 2: Issue Escalation
**Objective**: Test automatic escalation based on conversation patterns

**Test Steps**:
1. Initial technical issue:
   ```json
   {
     "user_id": "test-user-2",
     "message": "My password reset isn't working"
   }
   ```
   Expected: TECHNICAL_SUPPORT, normal priority

2. First follow-up (after 10 minutes):
   ```json
   {
     "user_id": "test-user-2",
     "message": "I've tried multiple times, still can't reset"
   }
   ```
   Expected: TECHNICAL_SUPPORT, HIGH urgency, isFollowUp: true

3. Frustration escalation:
   ```json
   {
     "user_id": "test-user-2",
     "message": "This is ridiculous! I've been locked out for hours!"
   }
   ```
   Expected: 
   - Intent changes to COMPLAINT
   - Routes to URGENT escalation (output 5)
   - `escalationReason`: "Technical issue unresolved, user frustrated"
   - All previous tickets referenced

**Success Criteria**:
- Progressive escalation works
- Intent evolution is tracked
- Executive escalation triggered appropriately

### Scenario 3: Context-Aware Responses
**Objective**: Verify the system understands contextual references

**Test Steps**:
1. Billing inquiry:
   ```json
   {
     "user_id": "test-user-3",
     "message": "What's my current account balance?"
   }
   ```
   Expected: BILLING_QUESTION

2. Contextual follow-up:
   ```json
   {
     "user_id": "test-user-3",
     "message": "Why is it so high?"
   }
   ```
   Expected:
   - BILLING_QUESTION
   - System understands "it" refers to balance
   - `contextFromHistory`: "User inquired about balance"

3. Further context:
   ```json
   {
     "user_id": "test-user-3",
     "message": "Can you explain the charges from last month?"
   }
   ```
   Expected:
   - BILLING_QUESTION
   - Maintains billing context
   - References previous balance inquiry

**Success Criteria**:
- Pronoun resolution works ("it", "that", etc.)
- Context carries through conversation
- Relevant history is included

### Scenario 4: Multi-User Isolation
**Objective**: Ensure memory doesn't leak between users

**Test Steps**:
1. User 1 technical issue:
   ```json
   {
     "user_id": "user-alpha",
     "message": "I forgot my password"
   }
   ```

2. User 2 different issue:
   ```json
   {
     "user_id": "user-beta",
     "message": "I want to cancel my subscription"
   }
   ```

3. User 1 follow-up:
   ```json
   {
     "user_id": "user-alpha",
     "message": "I still need help with this"
   }
   ```
   Expected: References password issue, NOT subscription

4. User 2 follow-up:
   ```json
   {
     "user_id": "user-beta",
     "message": "What about my refund?"
   }
   ```
   Expected: References subscription/billing, NOT password

**Success Criteria**:
- Each user has isolated memory
- No cross-contamination of contexts
- Correct history for each user

### Scenario 5: Memory Window Testing
**Objective**: Verify the 10-message window limit works correctly

**Test Steps**:
1. Send 12 messages from same user with different topics
2. Verify only last 10 are considered in context
3. Check that very old issues aren't referenced

**Success Criteria**:
- Only recent history affects classification
- Old messages roll off properly
- Performance remains good

### Scenario 6: Pattern Recognition
**Objective**: Test chronic issue detection

**Test Steps**:
1. Simulate recurring login issues over time:
   - Message 1: "Can't log in" (Day 1)
   - Message 2: "Login failed again" (Day 3)
   - Message 3: "Still having login problems" (Day 5)
   - Message 4: "This login issue is ongoing" (Day 7)
   - Message 5: "Login STILL broken!" (Day 10)

**Expected Result**:
- System detects pattern
- Automatic escalation after 3+ similar issues
- Suggests permanent solution
- Lists all related tickets

**Success Criteria**:
- Pattern detection triggers
- Appropriate escalation occurs
- Historical tickets are linked

### Scenario 7: Intent Evolution
**Objective**: Track how issues change over time

**Test Steps**:
1. Start with feature request:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "It would be nice to have dark mode"
   }
   ```
   Expected: FEATURE_REQUEST

2. Follow up with impatience:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "When will dark mode be available?"
   }
   ```
   Expected: Still FEATURE_REQUEST, but noted as follow-up

3. Escalate to complaint:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "You promised dark mode months ago!"
   }
   ```
   Expected: Changes to COMPLAINT, references feature request history

**Success Criteria**:
- Intent evolution is tracked
- Historical context preserved
- Appropriate routing changes

### Scenario 8: Session Timeout
**Objective**: Verify memory expires appropriately

**Test Steps**:
1. Send initial message
2. Wait for session timeout (configured timeout + 5 minutes)
3. Send follow-up message
4. Verify it's treated as new conversation

**Success Criteria**:
- Old sessions expire
- New session starts fresh
- No stale context used
