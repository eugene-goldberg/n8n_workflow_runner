# LangGraph Agentic RAG - Test Results Summary

## Project Overview

Successfully created a LangGraph-based agentic RAG system integrated with the spyro-agentic-rag Neo4j database containing 748 entities.

## Architecture Implemented

1. **LangGraph State Management**
   - Implemented StateGraph with proper routing and error handling
   - Removed PostgreSQL checkpointer dependency for simplified setup

2. **Multi-Strategy Retrieval**
   - GraphRetriever: Text2Cypher for structured queries ✅
   - VectorRetriever: Neo4j vector search (configured for spyro indexes)
   - HybridRetriever: Combined vector + fulltext search
   - VectorCypherRetriever: Vector search with graph expansion

3. **Intelligent Routing**
   - Routes queries to appropriate retrieval strategies
   - Handles relational queries, fact lookups, etc.

## Test Results with Business Questions

### Working Queries (3/5 = 60% success rate)

1. **Revenue Risk Analysis**
   ```
   Q: What percentage of our ARR is dependent on customers with success scores below 70?
   A: 20.61% of ARR
   ```

2. **Customer Health Analysis**
   ```
   Q: How many customers have success scores below 60, and what is their combined ARR?
   A: 5 customers with combined ARR of $10,800,000
   ```

3. **Churn Risk Identification**
   ```
   Q: Which customers are at highest risk of churn based on success scores and recent events?
   A: EduTech (score: 35), HealthTech Solutions (score: 41), StartupXYZ (score: 45)
   ```

### Failed Queries (2/5)

4. **Event Analysis** - Failed due to undefined vector_retriever in fact_lookup route
5. **Product Usage** - Failed due to Neo4j type error on AVG() function

## Key Achievements

1. ✅ Successfully integrated with spyro's Neo4j database (748 entities)
2. ✅ Proper LlamaIndex schema handling (:__Entity__:TYPE labels)
3. ✅ Dynamic Cypher query generation based on natural language
4. ✅ Intelligent routing between different retrieval strategies
5. ✅ Clean answer synthesis from graph query results

## Technical Details

### Neo4j Integration
- Database: `bolt://localhost:7687`
- Indexes used: `spyro_vector_index`, `spyro_fulltext_index`
- Key relationships: HAS_SUCCESS_SCORE, GENERATES, USES, MENTIONS

### Cypher Query Examples Generated
```cypher
-- ARR dependency query
MATCH (c:CUSTOMER)-[:HAS_SUCCESS_SCORE]->(css:CUSTOMER_SUCCESS_SCORE)
WHERE css.score < 70
MATCH (c)-[:SUBSCRIBES_TO]->(:SUBSCRIPTION)-[:GENERATES]->(r:REVENUE)
WITH sum(r.amount) AS low_score_revenue
MATCH (c:CUSTOMER)-[:SUBSCRIBES_TO]->(:SUBSCRIPTION)-[:GENERATES]->(r:REVENUE)
WITH low_score_revenue, sum(r.amount) AS total_revenue
RETURN (low_score_revenue / total_revenue) * 100 AS percentage_of_arr
```

## Remaining Issues

1. **fact_lookup route bug**: `vector_retriever` not defined in nodes.py
2. **Data quality**: Some SUBSCRIPTION nodes have non-numeric values
3. **Missing relationships**: Some expected relationships (e.g., HAS_SUBSCRIPTION) don't exist

## Running the System

```bash
# Install dependencies
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt

# Test single question
python scripts/test_single_question.py

# Test multiple questions
python scripts/test_agent_questions.py

# Check Neo4j schema
python scripts/check_neo4j_schema.py
```

## Conclusion

The LangGraph agentic RAG system successfully demonstrates:
- Advanced routing capabilities
- Natural language to Cypher translation
- Integration with existing Neo4j knowledge graph
- Proper handling of complex business queries

With minor fixes to the fact_lookup route and data quality improvements, this system could achieve >80% success rate on business questions.
