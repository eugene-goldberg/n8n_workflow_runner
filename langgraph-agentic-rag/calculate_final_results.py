print("""
1. Fix Text2Cypher Generation
   - Update to newer langchain-neo4j package
   - Add more specific Cypher examples to prompt
   - Handle edge cases in query generation

2. Add Missing Relationships
   - Team-department hierarchies
   - Feature-value mappings for enterprise
   - Cross-objective risk correlations

3. Implement Query Fallbacks
   - When graph query fails, try vector search
   - Combine multiple retrieval strategies
   - Post-process results for better answers
