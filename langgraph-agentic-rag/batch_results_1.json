    "answer": "The operational costs have a significant impact on the profitability of the top 10 customers. Based on the provided data from the graph results, we can see that the gross profit for each customer is calculated as the annual revenue minus the total operational costs. The profit margin is then calculated as the gross profit divided by the annual revenue, expressed as a percentage.\n\nHere are some examples from the graph results:\n1. Healthcare Plus (Customer):\n   - Gross Profit: -$4,789,335\n   - Profit Margin: -172.48%\n\n2. FinanceHub:\n   - Gross Profit: -$1,149,821\n   - Profit Margin: -54.0%\n\n3. CloudFirst:\n   - Gross Profit: -$5,927,301\n   - Profit Margin: -407.0%\n\n4. Global Manufacturing Co (Customer):\n   - Gross Profit: -$12,198,336\n   - Profit Margin: -907.88%\n\nFrom these results, it is evident that high operational costs can lead to negative gross profits and profit margins, indicating a significant impact on the overall profitability of the top customers.",
