# Vector Retriever Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Fixed `vector_retriever` Undefined Error
- **Problem**: `vector_retriever` was not defined in `search_tools.py`
- **Solution**: Changed line 39 from `vector_retriever` to `neo4j_vector_retriever`

### 2. Improved Router Logic for Event Queries
- **Problem**: Event-based queries were incorrectly routed to `fact_lookup`
- **Solution**: Enhanced router prompt with better descriptions and examples for `relational_query`
- **Result**: Questions about percentages, aggregations, and time-based analysis now correctly route to graph retriever

### 3. Created Enhanced Vector Retriever
- **Problem**: Standard vector retriever returns no results because entities only have names, not descriptive text
- **Solution**: Created `EnhancedVectorRetriever` that:
  - Searches entities by name embeddings
  - Enriches results with entity relationships
  - Supports filtering by entity type
  - Returns formatted, readable content

## Current Capabilities

### Vector Search (Enhanced)
- Searches 701 entities with embeddings
- Returns entity name, type, properties, and relationships
- Example: Query "customer health" finds "Customer Health Indicators" entity

### Graph Retriever
- Successfully generates Cypher queries for complex questions
- Handles:
  - Customer success score analysis
  - Event tracking and percentages
  - Revenue calculations
  - Risk assessments

### Router
- Correctly identifies query types:
  - `fact_lookup` → Enhanced vector search
  - `relational_query` → Graph Cypher queries
  - `hybrid_search` → Combined vector + fulltext

## Example Results

1. **"What percentage of customers experienced negative events?"**
   - Routes to: `relational_query`
   - Generates Cypher to count customers with negative events
   - Result: 0% (due to date filtering - events are from 2024)

2. **"How many customers have success scores below 60?"**
   - Routes to: `relational_query`
   - Generates proper aggregation query
   - Handles customer → subscription → revenue relationships

3. **Vector search for "customer health"**
   - Finds relevant entities like "Customer Health Indicators"
   - Shows relationships to metrics being tracked

## Remaining Limitations

1. **Date Handling**: Events are from 2024, so "last 90 days" queries return 0
2. **Data Quality**: Some subscription values are non-numeric, causing AVG() errors
3. **Relationship Gaps**: Limited EXPERIENCED relationships between customers and events (only 2)

## Running the Enhanced System

```bash
# Test vector search
python scripts/test_enhanced_vector.py

# Test specific questions
python scripts/test_events_question.py

# Run full test suite
python scripts/test_agent_questions.py
```

The LangGraph agentic RAG system now has a fully functional vector retriever that works with the entity-only embeddings in the spyro Neo4j database.
