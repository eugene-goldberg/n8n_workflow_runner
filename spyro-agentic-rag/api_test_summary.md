## Key Findings

### Working Well
1. **Financial Metrics**: ARR calculations, revenue percentages
2. **Customer Analytics**: Success scores, health scores, customer lists
3. **Risk Analysis**: Risk impacts, categories, mitigation status
4. **Product Metrics**: Adoption rates, support costs
5. **Marketing ROI**: Channel performance metrics
6. **Projections**: Q1-Q4 2025 revenue projections

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Data Patterns**:
   - No support ticket data
   - No integration issue details
   - No cross-functional dependencies
   - No external vendor dependencies
   - No executive sponsor data

2. **Data Quality Issues**:
   - 88/107 features have no release stage
   - All features marked as "internally driven"
   - 46/58 customers have no lifecycle stage
   - No product-specific recurring revenue

3. **Query Pattern Failures**:
   - Queries expecting counts often return "all" (58 customers)
   - Time-based queries (last quarter) often fail
   - Correlation queries lack necessary relationships

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Q7 (Projections)**: Data exists but query fails
2. **Fix Q52/Q53**: Recently fixed with relationship model
3. **Add missing data** for commonly asked metrics

### Data Model Improvements
1. **Add Support Ticket entities**
2. **Create Integration Issue tracking**
3. **Add Executive Sponsor relationships**
4. **Implement proper lifecycle stages**

### Query Improvements
1. **Better filtering** for "at risk" queries
2. **Time-based filtering** for quarterly data
3. **Correlation analysis** capabilities

## Success Rate Analysis
- **Current**: 56.7% grounded responses
- **Target**: >83% grounded responses
- **Gap**: 26.3% improvement needed

The system is performing reasonably well for core business metrics but needs improvement in data completeness and query sophistication to reach the target success rate.
