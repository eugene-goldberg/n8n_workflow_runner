# New Assessment Results - August 3, 2025

## Summary
Re-assessed all 60 business questions using `test_single_api_question.py` as requested.

**Overall Results:**
- **Total Questions**: 60
- **Grounded Responses**: 32 (53.3%)
- **Generic/Failed Responses**: 31 (46.7%)
- **Success Rate**: 53.3%

This is significantly lower than the previously reported 70% success rate.

## Grounded Queries (32)
✅ Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q8, Q9, Q10, Q12, Q14, Q18, Q21, Q26, Q27, Q30, Q32, Q34, Q38, Q39, Q40, Q43, Q45, Q46, Q49, Q51, Q52, Q53, Q55, Q58, Q59

## Failed/Generic Queries (31)
❌ Q5, Q6, Q7, Q11, Q13, Q15, Q16, Q17, Q19, Q20, Q22, Q23, Q24, Q25, Q28, Q29, Q31, Q33, Q35, Q36, Q37, Q41, Q42, Q44, Q47, Q48, Q50, Q54, Q56, Q57, Q60

## Key Observations

### Common Failure Patterns:
1. **Missing Data Types**: Features, integrations, support tickets, skill gaps
2. **Complex Relationships**: Cross-functional dependencies, correlations
3. **Time-Series Data**: Projections, trends, time-to-value metrics
4. **Aggregations**: Adoption rates, operational costs by team
5. **Missing Properties**: Priority levels, lifecycle stages, growth rates

### Notable Failures:
- Q5: Returns "technical difficulties" instead of actual percentage
- Q7: No projections found in relationship model
- Q17: Teams operational costs not available
- Q20: No correlation logic between support and churn
- Q37: Project priorities all showing as "unspecified"

## UI Update
The web interface has been updated to accurately reflect this 53.3% success rate:
- 31 queries now highlighted in yellow (failing)
- 32 queries displayed in white (working)

## Conclusion
The actual success rate is **53.3%**, well below the 83% target. The discrepancy from earlier reports suggests that:
1. Some test methodologies may have been more lenient in counting "grounded" responses
2. The API endpoint testing reveals more failures than direct agent testing
3. Many queries that appear to work may return partial or generic data

Further improvements needed to reach the 83% success target.
