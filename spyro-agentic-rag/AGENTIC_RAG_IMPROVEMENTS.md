# Agentic RAG Improvements - January 2025

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the SpyroSolutions Agentic RAG system to achieve a 91.7% success rate on business queries, up from the initial 83.3% baseline.

## Problem Statement
The system was returning generic responses ("no specific entries found") for many business-critical queries due to:
1. Missing data relationships in Neo4j
2. Incomplete Cypher query examples
3. Schema mismatch between Spyro RAG and LlamaIndex formats

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Data Model
Added missing data structures to Neo4j:

#### Company Objectives
- Created 5 strategic objectives: Market Expansion, Product Innovation, Customer Retention, Operational Excellence, Revenue Growth
- Linked risks to objectives via `AFFECTS` relationships

#### Feature Promises
- Created `PROMISED_FEATURE` relationships between customers and features
- Added delivery status tracking (DELIVERED, IN_PROGRESS, AT_RISK, DELAYED)
- Included promised delivery dates

#### Roadmap Management
- Added 12 RoadmapItem nodes with status and priority
- Created `RESPONSIBLE_FOR` relationships between teams and roadmap items
- Linked roadmap items to features via `IMPLEMENTS` relationships

#### Feature Adoption Metrics
- Added adoption_rate, active_users, and released_timeframe to features
- Marked recent features with is_new_feature flag

#### Customer Concern Actions
- Enhanced concern nodes with action_taken and action_status properties
- Added specific mitigation strategies for each concern type

### 2. Enhanced Cypher Examples
Created `cypher_examples_enhanced_v2.py` with:
- 15 comprehensive query examples covering all business scenarios
- Proper handling of dual schema format (Spyro RAG + LlamaIndex)
- Examples for complex queries like feature promises, objective risks, and roadmap delays

### 3. Schema Compatibility
All queries now handle both formats:
```cypher
WHERE ('Customer' IN labels(c) OR ('__Entity__' IN labels(c) AND 'CUSTOMER' IN labels(c)))
```

## Results

### Success Metrics
- **Initial State**: 83.3% success rate with manual query handlers
- **Final State**: 91.7% success rate with autonomous agent
- **Improvement**: +8.4% while removing manual interventions

### Query Categories Performance
1. **Revenue & Financial**: 90%+ success
2. **Customer Success**: 95%+ success  
3. **Product & Features**: 85%+ success
4. **Risk Management**: 90%+ success
5. **Team & Resources**: 95%+ success
6. **Strategic Planning**: 90%+ success

### Sample Successful Queries
- "Which features were promised to customers, and what is their delivery status?" ✅
- "What are the top risks related to achieving Market Expansion objective?" ✅
- "Which teams are responsible for delayed roadmap items?" ✅
- "What percentage of roadmap items are currently behind schedule?" ✅

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. `src/agents/spyro_agent_enhanced_fixed.py` - Main agent with autonomous tool selection
2. `src/utils/cypher_examples_enhanced_v2.py` - Enhanced Cypher examples
3. `src/api/main.py` - Updated to use enhanced agent
4. `webapp/src/App.tsx` - UI with all 60 business questions
5. `webapp/src/businessQuestions.ts` - Categorized business questions

### New Scripts
1. `fix_missing_data_v2.py` - Adds missing data structures to Neo4j
2. `test_all_60_queries_final.py` - Comprehensive testing suite
3. `analyze_missing_data.py` - Diagnostic tool for data gaps

## Usage

### Running the System
```bash
# Start API server
cd spyro-agentic-rag
./venv/bin/uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Start web app (separate terminal)
cd webapp
npm start
```

### Testing
```bash
# Test specific queries
./venv/bin/python test_fixed_queries.py

# Test full suite
./venv/bin/python test_all_60_queries_final.py
```

## Future Enhancements
1. Add more granular adoption metrics at feature level
2. Implement real-time risk scoring algorithms
3. Create automated data ingestion for roadmap updates
4. Add predictive analytics for churn risk

## Conclusion
The Agentic RAG system now provides accurate, data-driven answers to 91.7% of business queries while maintaining true agent autonomy. The system intelligently selects between vector search, graph queries, and hybrid approaches based on the query context.
