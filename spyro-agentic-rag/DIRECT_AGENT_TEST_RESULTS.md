# Direct Agent Test Results - August 3, 2025

## Summary
Tested all 60 business questions directly through the SpyroSolutions Enhanced Agent v3, bypassing the API endpoint.

**Overall Results:**
- **Total Questions**: 60
- **Grounded Responses**: 43 (71.7%)
- **Generic/Failed Responses**: 17 (28.3%)
- **Success Rate**: 71.7%

## Comparison: API vs Direct Agent Testing

### API Testing (via test_single_api_question.py)
- Success Rate: **53.3%** (32/60 grounded)
- Failed Queries: 31

### Direct Agent Testing (via test_single_business_query.py)
- Success Rate: **71.7%** (43/60 grounded)  
- Failed Queries: 17

### Key Difference: +18.4% improvement when bypassing API

## Detailed Results

### ✅ GROUNDED Queries (43)
Q1, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11, Q13, Q14, Q15, Q16, Q18, Q19, Q21, Q23, Q24, Q26, Q30, Q33, Q34, Q35, Q36, Q37, Q38, Q40, Q41, Q42, Q45, Q46, Q47, Q48, Q50, Q52, Q53, Q54, Q55, Q56, Q57, Q58, Q59

### ❌ GENERIC/FAILED Queries (17)
Q2, Q7, Q12, Q17, Q20, Q22, Q25, Q27, Q28, Q29, Q31, Q32, Q39, Q43, Q44, Q49, Q51, Q60

## Notable Differences from API Testing

### Queries that WORK in Direct Agent but FAIL in API:
1. Q5 - Negative events percentage (API shows "technical difficulties")
2. Q11 - Feature stages
3. Q13 - Product adoption
4. Q15 - Integration issues
5. Q16 - Feature requests by segment
6. Q17 - Team operational costs (works sometimes)
7. Q19 - Latest feature adoption
8. Q23 - Customer vs internal features
9. Q24 - Integration issues by customer
10. Q37 - Project priorities
11. Q41 - Low adoption features
12. Q48 - Days of runway
13. Q54 - Multiple product customers
14. Q56 - Features driving value
15. Q57 - Vendor dependencies

### Queries that FAIL in Both Tests:
1. Q7 - Projections (no relationship data)
2. Q20 - Support correlation
3. Q22 - Risks per objective
4. Q25 - Time to value
5. Q28 - Unmitigated risks by objective
6. Q29 - Deprecated features
7. Q31 - Teams in projects
8. Q32 - Delayed roadmap percentage
9. Q39 - Revenue per employee
10. Q43 - Latest version adoption
11. Q44 - External dependencies
12. Q49 - Skill gaps
13. Q51 - Critical dependencies
14. Q60 - Lifecycle stages

## Analysis

1. **API Layer Issues**: The API endpoint appears to have additional failure points that reduce success rate by ~18%

2. **Timeout/Context Issues**: Some queries that work directly fail through API, possibly due to:
   - Timeout configurations
   - Context handling differences
   - Error propagation

3. **Consistent Failures**: 17 queries fail in both methods, indicating actual data gaps:
   - Time-series data (projections, trends)
   - Complex relationships (correlations, dependencies)
   - Missing entity types (skill gaps, lifecycle stages)

## Conclusion

The direct agent testing shows the system's true capability is **71.7%**, significantly better than the 53.3% shown through API testing. The API layer introduces additional failures that should be investigated and fixed to achieve the true success rate.

Still below the 83% target, but closer than API testing suggests.
