- [x] Example query buttons
- [x] Metadata display (execution time, tokens, model)
- [x] Proxy configuration for API communication
- [x] Environment-based configuration

### 5. Database & Knowledge Graph
- [x] Neo4j database initialized with SpyroSolutions data
- [x] Entities: Products, Customers, Subscriptions, Teams, Projects, Risks, Objectives
- [x] Relationships properly mapped
- [x] Vector and fulltext indexes created
- [x] Sample data loaded

### 6. Testing & Optimization
- [x] Comprehensive test suite created
- [x] Business questions test with 60+ real-world queries
- [x] Tool selection accuracy: **100%** (exceeds 95% target)
- [x] Reliability: **0.00% error rate** (exceeds <0.1% target)
- [x] Multiple test utilities for verification

## üöÄ Running the System

### Backend API
```bash
cd /Users/eugene/dev/apps/n8n_workflow_runner/spyro-agentic-rag
source venv/bin/activate
python -m src.api.main
```

### Web Application
```bash
cd /Users/eugene/dev/apps/n8n_workflow_runner/spyro-agentic-rag/webapp
npm install  # First time only
npm start
```

Access at: http://localhost:3000

## üìù Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Performance**: Average response time (8.83s) exceeds 3s target
   - Primarily due to LLM processing time
   - Could be optimized with caching or smaller models for tool selection

2. **Answer Quality**: 83.3% quality score below 90% target
   - Some Cypher queries need enhancement for complex aggregations
   - Text2Cypher occasionally generates suboptimal queries

3. **Schema Gaps**: Missing entities/properties in test data:
   - `RoadmapItem` label
   - Properties: `timestamp`, `trend`, `estimated_completion`

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement response caching
   - Optimize Cypher query generation
   - Consider streaming responses

2. **Answer Quality Improvement**
   - Enhance Text2Cypher prompts
   - Add query validation and retry logic
   - Improve result synthesis

3. **Schema Completion**
   - Add missing entities and properties
   - Enhance sample data coverage

4. **Production Readiness**
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add monitoring and observability
   - Security hardening
