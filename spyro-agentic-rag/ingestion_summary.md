## Next Steps

1. **Test the enhanced RAG system**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/eugene/dev/apps/n8n_workflow_runner/spyro-agentic-rag
   ./scripts/test_all_business_questions.sh
   ```

2. **Verify specific gap questions**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test_llamaindex_queries.sh
   ```

3. **Compare results** with the previous test run to confirm all gaps are filled

## Technical Notes
- Ingestion was done one PDF at a time with 30-second delays to avoid API rate limits
- All PDFs were successfully parsed and entities/relationships extracted
- The LlamaIndex schema format (`:__Entity__:TYPE`) was properly applied
- Knowledge graph indexes were created for optimal query performance

The SpyroSolutions RAG system should now be able to answer all 50 business questions with comprehensive data!
