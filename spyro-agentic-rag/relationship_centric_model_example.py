    By converting properties to relationships, we:
    1. Align with how LLMs are trained to think about graphs
    2. Eliminate the need for property name discovery
    3. Enable natural query patterns that match LLM strengths
    4. Maintain semantic richness through typed relationships
    
    This isn't adding complexity - it's making the model more LLM-native.
