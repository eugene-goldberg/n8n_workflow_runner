STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

1. Revenue Concentration Risk
   Our top 5 customers (TechCorp, GlobalRetail, AutoDrive, CloudFirst, EnergyCore) generate 80% of revenue ($62M). TechCorp alone represents 10.3% of total revenue. Any churn in this segment would significantly impact financial performance.

2. Product-Market Fit Analysis
   SpyroSecure shows the strongest product-market fit with an average customer success score of 81.7, despite having the lowest profit margin. SpyroCloud exhibits concerning variability with 55% of customers below the healthy threshold.

3. Operational Constraints Impact
   Six teams are operating above capacity, directly impacting our ability to deliver on customer commitments. The Cloud Platform Team (120% utilization) is the primary bottleneck, affecting $17M in customer commitments.

4. Competitive Threats
   Three customers (RetailPlus, DataSync, StartupXYZ) are actively evaluating competitors. Combined revenue at risk: $7.5M. Primary drivers are performance issues and missing features.

CRITICAL DECISIONS REQUIRED

1. Resource Allocation
   Should we hire 8 additional engineers (annual cost: $1.6M) or accept roadmap delays impacting $15M in revenue?

2. At-Risk Customer Strategy
   EduTech (35 score) and StartupXYZ (45 score) require immediate intervention. Options:
   - Dedicated success resources (cost: $200K)
   - Product customization (3-month delay to roadmap)
   - Accept churn (lose $3.5M ARR)

3. Product Investment Priority
   - Option A: Fix SpyroCloud scalability ($3M investment, addresses 5 customer concerns)
   - Option B: Accelerate AI Enhancement ($4M investment, unlocks $7M in new revenue)
   - Option C: Improve SpyroSecure margins ($2M investment, increases margin to 25%)

4. Market Expansion Timing
   Current plan targets Q3 2025 for Asia expansion. However:
   - 3 high-severity risks must be resolved first
   - Requires 15 additional hires
   - Projected revenue opportunity: $12M
