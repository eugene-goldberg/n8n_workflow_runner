SPYROSOLUTIONS CUSTOMER ANALYSIS REPORT
Q4 2024 Executive Summary
========================

REVENUE AT RISK ANALYSIS

Our analysis indicates that approximately $11.8M in annual recurring revenue is currently at risk across our customer base. This represents 15.2% of our total ARR of $77.5M. The primary drivers of this risk are:

1. Customer Success Score Deterioration
   - 6 customers have success scores below 60 (critical threshold)
   - Combined ARR of at-risk customers: $11.8M
   - Most affected: StartupXYZ ($2M), EduTech ($1.5M), DataSync ($2.5M)

2. High-Risk Customer Profiles
   - StartupXYZ (45 score, declining): Has experienced 3 negative events in the past 90 days including a major service outage. Churn probability: 70%
   - EduTech (35 score, declining): Critical security incident last month dropped their score by 15 points. Churn probability: 80%
   - DataSync (52 score, declining): Performance issues leading to high support ticket volume. Churn probability: 60%

CUSTOMER SUCCESS PATTERNS

Top Performing Customers:
- HealthNet (92 score): Recently passed security audit, strong adoption of SpyroSecure
- CloudFirst (88 score): Expanding usage, requested additional licenses
- TechCorp (85 score): Stable with $8M ARR, our largest customer

Success Score Distribution:
- Above 80: 5 customers (32.5% of ARR)
- 60-80: 4 customers (36.4% of ARR)
- Below 60: 6 customers (31.1% of ARR)

PRODUCT-CUSTOMER ALIGNMENT

SpyroCloud customers show the highest variability in success scores, with 5 of 9 SpyroCloud customers below 70. This suggests potential product-market fit issues in certain segments. SpyroSecure customers demonstrate the highest average success score (81.7), indicating strong product-market fit in the security compliance space.

REGIONAL ANALYSIS

North America accounts for 58% of total revenue but also 65% of at-risk revenue. European customers show more stable success scores, with an average trend of "improving" compared to "declining" in other regions.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Immediate intervention required for StartupXYZ and EduTech
2. Accelerate delivery of roadmap items affecting at-risk customers
3. Consider dedicated success resources for customers below 60 score
4. Investigate SpyroCloud product-market fit issues
