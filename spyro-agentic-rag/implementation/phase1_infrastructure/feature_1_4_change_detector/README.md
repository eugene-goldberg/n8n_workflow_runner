# Feature 1.4: Change Detector

## Overview
The Change Detector identifies changes in source data to enable incremental updates to the knowledge base. It tracks entity state, detects creates/updates/deletes, and filters changes based on significance rules.

## Status
✅ **Completed**

## Specifications

### Size
Medium (3-4 days)

### Dependencies
- Feature 1.1 (Base Connector Framework) ✅
- Feature 1.2 (Mock Data Connector) ✅

### Description
Build a change detection system that:
- Tracks entity state over time
- Detects creates, updates, and deletes
- Identifies significant vs insignificant changes
- Supports custom change detection rules
- Handles large datasets efficiently
- Provides change history and rollback

## Implementation Checklist

### Core Components
- [x] Create `Change` data model
- [x] Implement `ChangeDetector` class
- [x] Build `StateStore` interface
- [x] Create in-memory state store
- [x] Add persistent state store (file-based)
- [x] Implement change significance rules

### Change Detection Features
- [x] Entity creation detection
- [x] Field update detection
- [x] Entity deletion detection
- [x] Bulk change detection
- [x] Change filtering by significance
- [x] Change aggregation

### State Management
- [x] State snapshot creation
- [x] State comparison logic
- [x] State persistence
- [x] State recovery
- [x] State versioning
- [x] Memory optimization

## Change Model

```python
@dataclass
class Change:
    entity_type: str
    entity_id: str
    operation: str  # create, update, delete
    fields_changed: List[str]
    old_values: Dict[str, Any]
    new_values: Dict[str, Any]
    timestamp: datetime
    significance: float  # 0.0-1.0
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
```

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Accurately detects all changes
2. Filters insignificant changes (< 5% threshold)
3. Handles 100K+ entities efficiently
4. Supports rollback to previous states
5. Provides detailed change history
6. 90%+ test coverage

## Test Scenarios
1. Basic CRUD detection ✅
2. Bulk change processing ✅
3. Significance filtering ✅
4. State persistence/recovery ✅
5. Performance with large datasets ✅
6. Concurrent change detection ✅
7. Change aggregation ✅
8. Error handling ✅
