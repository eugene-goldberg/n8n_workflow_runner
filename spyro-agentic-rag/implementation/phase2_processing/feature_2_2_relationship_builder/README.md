# Feature 2.2: Relationship Builder

## Overview
The Relationship Builder discovers and constructs relationships between entities using multiple strategies including explicit ID matching, semantic inference, temporal correlation, and graph pattern recognition.

## Status
✅ **Complete** (Ready for testing and integration)

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Explicit Relationship Detection**: ID-based relationships, foreign keys, hierarchies
- **Semantic Relationship Inference**: LLM-based discovery from text
- **Temporal Relationship Analysis**: Time-based correlations and causality
- **Multi-Hop Discovery**: Path finding and transitive relationships
- **Graph Pattern Recognition**: Hub detection, communities, collaboration patterns

### Components
1. **RelationshipBuilder**: Core relationship building functionality
2. **MultiHopRelationshipDiscoverer**: Find complex multi-entity relationships
3. **TemporalRelationshipAnalyzer**: Discover time-based relationships
4. **SemanticRelationshipMiner**: Extract relationships from text
5. **GraphPatternRecognizer**: Identify graph patterns

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Relationship Building
```python
from src.relationship_builder import RelationshipBuilder
from src.models import Entity

# Initialize builder
builder = RelationshipBuilder()

# Build relationships
entities = [...]  # List of entities
relationships = await builder.build_relationships(entities)
```

### Multi-Hop Discovery
```python
from src.multi_hop_discoverer import MultiHopRelationshipDiscoverer

discoverer = MultiHopRelationshipDiscoverer()
multi_hop_relationships = await discoverer.discover_multi_hop(entities, max_hops=3)
```

### Temporal Analysis
```python
from src.temporal_analyzer import TemporalRelationshipAnalyzer

analyzer = TemporalRelationshipAnalyzer()
temporal_correlations = await analyzer.analyze_temporal_patterns(entities, events)
```

## Configuration

Edit `config/relationship_builder.yaml`:

```yaml
relationship_discovery:
  explicit:
    enable: true
    rules_file: "config/relationship_rules.yaml"
    
  semantic:
    enable: true
    confidence_threshold: 0.7
    llm_model: "gpt-4"
    
  temporal:
    enable: true
    correlation_window_days: 90
    min_correlation: 0.6
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_relationship_builder.py
```
