- LLM services - Placeholders for enhanced extraction
- Graph databases - Export ready with serialization

## Next Steps for Integration

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Download spaCy model: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
3. Configure relationship rules in `config/` directory
4. Use RelationshipBuilder as main entry point
5. Combine with other Phase 2 features for complete pipeline

## Notes

- All async/await patterns implemented for scalability
- Comprehensive error handling throughout
