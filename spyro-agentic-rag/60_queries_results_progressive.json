Customers with scores closer to 0 are at higher risk.\n\n2. **Recent Events**: Check for any recent negative events associated with customers. The `EVENT` entity has a `type` property that includes types like `support_escalation` or `security_incident`, which might indicate dissatisfaction or issues.\n\n3. **Combining Data**: Ideally, you would combine these two data points to identify customers who have both low success scores and have experienced recent negative events.\n\nIf you have access to the database, you can manually query these entities and relationships to identify the customers at the highest risk of churn.

This might be related to the `TEAM` entity, as teams are responsible for supporting customers.\n\n2. **Calculate Costs**: The `TEAM` entity has properties like `monthly_cost` and `operational_cost`. These costs could be associated with supporting customers.\n\n3. **Link to Customers**: The relationship `(TEAM)-[:SUPPORTS]->(CUSTOMER)` can be used to determine which teams support which customers.\n\n4. **Calculate Cost per Customer**: For each team (or support tier), calculate the total cost and divide it by the number of customers they support.\n\nUnfortunately, without direct access to the data, I can't provide specific numbers. If you have access to the database, you might consider querying the `TEAM` and `CUSTOMER` entities and their relationships to manually calculate the cost per customer for each support tier.

      "question": "What is the relationship between product usage and renewal probability?",
      "answer": "The relationship between product usage and renewal probability can be observed from the following data:\n\n1. **TechCorp** using **SpyroCloud**:\n   - Product Usage: 4975\n   - Renewal Probability: 85%\n\n2. **FinanceHub** using **SpyroSecure** and **SpyroAI**:\n   - Product Usage: 3225\n   - Renewal Probability: 90%\n\n3. **StartupXYZ** using **SpyroCloud**:\n   - Product Usage: Not available\n   - Renewal Probability: 35%\n\n4. **RetailPlus** using **SpyroCloud**:\n   - Product Usage: Not available\n   - Renewal Probability: 55%\n\n5. **HealthNet** using **SpyroSecure**:\n   - Product Usage: 1816\n   - Renewal Probability: 92%\n\n6. **EduTech** using **SpyroAI**:\n   - Product Usage: Not available\n   - Renewal Probability: 25%\n\n7. **LogiCorp** using **SpyroCloud**:\n   - Product Usage: Not available\n   - Renewal Probability: 70%\n\n### Analysis:\n- Higher product usage tends to correlate with higher renewal probabilities. For example, TechCorp and FinanceHub, with significant product usage, have high renewal probabilities (85% and 90% respectively).\n- Conversely, companies like StartupXYZ and EduTech, with lower or unavailable product usage data, show lower renewal probabilities (35% and 25% respectively).\n- HealthNet, with moderate usage, also shows a high renewal probability of 92%, indicating that even moderate usage can lead to high renewal likelihood if the product meets the customer's needs.\n\nThis suggests a positive correlation between product usage and renewal probability, where increased usage often leads to higher chances of renewal. However, other factors may also influence renewal decisions, such as customer satisfaction and product fit.",
