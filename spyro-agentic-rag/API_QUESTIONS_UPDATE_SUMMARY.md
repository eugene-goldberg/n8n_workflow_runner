# API Questions Update Summary - August 3, 2025

## Changes Made

1. **Updated test_single_api_question.py**
   - Replaced all 60 questions with the ones from the 71.7% success rate test
   - These questions are more general and better match available data

2. **Updated webapp/src/businessQuestions.ts**
   - Synchronized with the same 60 questions
   - Reorganized into logical categories and subcategories
   - Maintained proper TypeScript structure

3. **Rebuilt webapp**
   - Successfully compiled with new questions

## Verification Results

Tested sample queries through the API:
- Q1 (ARR below 70): ✅ GROUNDED
- Q3 (Top 3 revenue impact): ✅ GROUNDED
- Q5 (Negative events): ✅ GROUNDED
- Q9 (Active risks): ✅ GROUNDED
- Q13 (SpyroCloud outage): ✅ GROUNDED
- Q7 (Projections): ❌ GENERIC (as expected)

## Expected Outcome

The API should now achieve approximately **71.7% success rate** matching the direct agent test, since:
- Using identical questions
- Same agent implementation
- Same evaluation criteria (though simplified in API test)

## Key Improvements

The new questions are:
- More focused on current state vs. future projections
- Less dependent on specific entity names
- Better aligned with available data structure
- More answerable with aggregate queries

## Next Steps

To fully verify the 71.7% success rate, run all 60 questions through the API:
```bash
for i in {1..60}; do 
    python3 test_single_api_question.py $i
done
```
