# Graph RAG Enhanced Model Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-07-31

### Successfully Tested Queries

#### 1. Complex Relationship Query (Hybrid Search ✅)
**Query**: "Show me how Disney's recent service outage event impacts their subscription value, project timelines, and team allocations"
- **Tools Used**: vector_search + graph_search
- **Result**: Successfully triggered hybrid search combining semantic understanding with relationship traversal

#### 2. Objective Risk Analysis (Hybrid Search ✅)
**Query**: "What are the top risks threatening our Q1 2025 customer retention objective and how do they relate to Disney and EA?"
- **Tools Used**: vector_search + graph_search
- **Result**: Properly identified need for both semantic search and entity relationship mapping

#### 3. Entity Relationship Tracing (Graph Search ✅)
**Query**: "Trace the relationship between EA's security alert event and their customer success score, including which teams are involved"
- **Tools Used**: graph_search (2x)
- **Result**: Pure graph traversal for multi-hop relationship query

#### 4. At-Risk Projects Query (Graph Search ✅)
**Query**: "Show me all at-risk projects and which teams from Disney and Netflix are working on them with their capacity utilization"
- **Tools Used**: graph_search (2x)
- **Result**: Successfully identified entity relationships requiring graph traversal

### Key Findings

1. **Graph Search Triggers**:
   - Queries mentioning 2+ specific entities (Disney, EA, Netflix, etc.)
   - Relationship tracing requests ("trace", "relationship between", "how X relates to Y")
   - Multi-hop queries requiring traversal through multiple entity types

2. **Hybrid Search Triggers**:
   - Complex business impact analysis
   - Queries combining general concepts with specific entities
   - Questions requiring both semantic understanding and relationship mapping

3. **Pure Vector Search**:
   - Single entity queries without relationship context
   - General semantic questions without named entities

### Enhanced Model Capabilities

The enhanced Graph RAG model now supports:
- **Financial Relationships**: ARR, MRR, subscription values
- **Project Management**: Team allocations, project status, deadlines
- **Risk Analysis**: Events, impacts, success scores
- **Operational Metrics**: Costs, utilization, SLA compliance
- **Strategic Planning**: Objectives, roadmaps, commitments

### Performance Observations

- Graph search response times: ~9-13 seconds
- Hybrid search response times: ~11-13 seconds
- Vector search response times: ~7-8 seconds
- Tool transparency working correctly
- Relationship traversal functioning as expected

   - Response time: ~14 seconds

### Next Steps

1. Continue testing with more complex multi-entity queries
2. Optimize graph query performance for faster response times
3. Enhance the agent's ability to determine when to use graph vs vector search
4. Add more sophisticated relationship patterns to the graph model
