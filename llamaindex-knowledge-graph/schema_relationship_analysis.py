1. LlamaIndex IS correctly following your semantic model structure
2. It extracts the same entities and relationships from the documents
3. The ONLY difference is the labeling convention:
   - Your model/Spyro RAG: Uses "Customer", "Product", "Team" (TitleCase)
   - LlamaIndex: Uses "__Entity__" + "CUSTOMER", "PRODUCT", "TEAM" (UPPERCASE)

4. The relationships are preserved exactly as in your model:
   - Customer → SaaS Subscription ✓
   - Customer → Risk ✓
   - Team → Project ✓
   - All the arrows in your diagram become relationship types

5. This is actually GOOD NEWS because:
   - No data is lost or misrepresented
   - The semantic structure is intact
   - We just need to handle the label format difference
