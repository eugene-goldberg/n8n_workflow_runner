print("\n=== ANALYSIS SUMMARY ===")
print("""
The LlamaIndex schema DOES capture the semantic model, but with different conventions:

1. LABELING CONVENTION:
   - LlamaIndex: Uses UPPERCASE labels (CUSTOMER, PRODUCT) with __Entity__ marker
   - Spyro RAG: Uses TitleCase labels (Customer, Product)

2. ENTITY COVERAGE:
   - ✓ Core entities are captured (Customer, Product, Team, Project)
   - ✓ Financial entities present (Revenue, Cost, Profitability)
   - ✓ Operational entities included (Risk, SLA, Events)

3. RELATIONSHIP PRESERVATION:
   - LlamaIndex extracts relationships like SUBSCRIBES_TO, HAS_RISK, WORKS_FOR
   - These map to the arrows in the semantic model

4. THE GOOD NEWS:
   - The data IS there and correctly structured
   - It follows the semantic model relationships
   - Only the label format differs

5. SOLUTION APPROACH:
   - Option A: Modify LlamaIndex to use Spyro's label convention
   - Option B: Update Spyro RAG to recognize both formats
   - Option C: Create a view/transformation layer
