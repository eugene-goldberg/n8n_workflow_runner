LlamaIndex DOES implement your semantic model correctly:

1. ENTITIES ARE PRESERVED:
   ✓ Customer → Stored as CUSTOMER entities
   ✓ Product → Products found (SpyroCloud, SpyroAI, etc.)
   ✓ Team → Team entities (AI Research Team, etc.)
   ✓ Risk → Risk entities with proper relationships
   ✓ Financial entities (Revenue, Costs, etc.)

2. RELATIONSHIPS MATCH YOUR MODEL:
   ✓ Customer → SaaS Subscription (SUBSCRIBES_TO)
   ✓ Customer → Risk (HAS_RISK)
   ✓ Team → Project (RESPONSIBLE_FOR, DEVELOPS)
   ✓ Subscription → Revenue (GENERATES)
   ✓ Risk → Objective (AT_RISK, IMPACTS)

3. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE:
   - Label Format: Customer vs CUSTOMER
   - Label Structure: :Customer vs :__Entity__:CUSTOMER
   
This is a NAMING CONVENTION difference, not a structural difference.
Your semantic model is fully preserved in the LlamaIndex implementation.
