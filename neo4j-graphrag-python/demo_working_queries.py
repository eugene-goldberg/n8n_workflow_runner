print("\n💡 Key Insights:")
print("- The system successfully retrieves information from text chunks")
print("- Vector search understands semantic meaning (e.g., 'cloud infrastructure' → SpyroCloud)")
print("- All business data is accessible through natural language queries")
print("- The hybrid retriever combines vector and fulltext search effectively")

print("\n⚠️  Current Limitation:")
print("- Graph traversal queries (use_cypher=True) generate Cypher but don't utilize graph structure for retrieval")
print("- This is a limitation of the neo4j-graphrag-python library's current implementation")
print("- The library focuses on chunk retrieval enhanced by graph context, not direct graph querying")
