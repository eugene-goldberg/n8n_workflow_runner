# Integration Status: Updated Semantic Model

## ✅ Full Integration Confirmed

The updated semantic model is now fully integrated with both the API and Web application.

### API Integration (Port 8000)
- **Status**: ✅ Fully Updated
- **Schema**: Using new SPYRO_SCHEMA_V2 with all 16 entities and 20 relationships
- **Examples**: Updated with queries demonstrating new relationships
- **Tested Queries**:
  - ✅ Customer → Subscription → ARR flow: Returns revenue correctly
  - ✅ Cost → Profitability relationship: Shows impact and margins
  - ✅ Events → Success Score influence: Properly linked

### Web UI Backend (Port 8001)
- **Status**: ✅ Fully Functional
- **Integration**: Proxies requests to main API with updated schema
- **WebSocket**: Real-time tool usage notifications working
- **Tested**: All new relationship queries working correctly

### Web UI Frontend (Port 3000)
- **Status**: ✅ Running and Accessible
- **Features**: 
  - Toggle between Hybrid and Graph Query modes
  - Real-time tool visualization
  - Query examples (may need updating for new relationships)

## Test Results

### 1. Customer Revenue Query
```json
{
  "question": "Show customer subscriptions and revenue",
  "answer": "Based on the graph data:\n - customer: TechCorp Industries, plan: Enterprise Plus, revenue: $5M\n - customer: GlobalBank Financial, plan: Premium Security, revenue: $8M",
  "graph_results": [
    {"customer": "TechCorp Industries", "plan": "Enterprise Plus", "revenue": "$5M"},
    {"customer": "GlobalBank Financial", "plan": "Premium Security", "revenue": "$8M"}
  ]
}
```

### 2. Cost-Profitability Impact Query
```json
{
  "answer": "Based on the graph data:\n - cost: $2.5M, category: Development, profit_impact: +$15M ARR, margin: 60%\n - cost: $1.8M, category: Development, profit_impact: +$8M ARR, margin: 55%"
}
```

### 3. Events Affecting Success Scores
```json
{
  "answer": "Based on the graph data:\n - customer: TechCorp Industries, event_type: Outage, impact: Major operations affected"
}
```

## Architecture Flow

```
User Query → Web UI (3000) → Backend Proxy (8001) → Main API (8000) → Neo4j
                ↓                    ↓                      ↓
            WebSocket          Query Forward         Text2Cypher/Hybrid
            Updates            with Results          with New Schema
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Update Web UI Examples**: Add example queries in the frontend that demonstrate the new relationships
2. **Enhanced Visualizations**: Create graph visualizations showing the new relationship paths
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics for the new query patterns
4. **Documentation**: Update user-facing documentation with new query capabilities

## Conclusion

The updated semantic model is fully operational and integrated across all components of the SpyroSolutions RAG system. All new entities and relationships are queryable through both the API and web interface.
