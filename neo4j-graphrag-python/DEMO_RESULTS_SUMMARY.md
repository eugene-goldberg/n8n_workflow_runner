## 3. HybridRetriever Results

### Query: "What products does SpyroSolutions offer?"
**Combined vector + fulltext search found same chunks but faster (177ms vs 488ms)**

## 4. GraphRAG Complete Q&A Results

### Question: "What are the key products offered by SpyroSolutions and their SLA guarantees?"
**Answer:**
SpyroSolutions offers the following key products along with their SLA guarantees:

1. **SpyroCloud Platform**
   - SLA: 99.99% uptime guarantee

2. **SpyroAI Analytics**
   - SLA: 99.9% uptime, with a query response time of less than 2 seconds

3. **SpyroSecure**
   - SLA: 99.99% threat detection rate

### Question: "Which customers are at risk and what are their subscription values?"
**Answer:**
The customers at risk are:

1. TechCorp Industries
   - Risk: Medium - Considering competitive solutions
   - SaaS Subscription Value: $5M ARR

2. RetailMax Corporation
   - Risk: High - Feature gaps affecting satisfaction
   - SaaS Subscription Value: $3M ARR

### Question: "How are the engineering teams organized across products?"
**Answer:**
The engineering teams are organized as follows:

1. **SpyroCloud Platform**: Assigned to the Platform Engineering Team, which consists of 45 engineers
2. **SpyroAI Analytics**: Managed by the AI/ML Team, comprising 30 engineers
3. **SpyroSecure**: Handled by the Security Team, which includes 25 engineers

## Performance Metrics

| Retriever Type | Query | Response Time |
|----------------|-------|---------------|
| VectorRetriever | Product search | 488ms |
| HybridRetriever | Product search | 177ms |
| Text2CypherRetriever | Customer subscriptions | 1092ms |
| Text2CypherRetriever | Team assignments | 1033ms |
| GraphRAG | Product SLAs | 2137ms |
| GraphRAG | At-risk customers | 2845ms |
| GraphRAG | Team organization | 3200ms |

## Key Findings

1. **Text2CypherRetriever** successfully converts natural language to Cypher queries and returns actual graph data (customer names, ARR values, team assignments)

2. **HybridRetriever** is faster than pure VectorRetriever (177ms vs 488ms) while providing similar results

3. **GraphRAG** provides comprehensive natural language answers by combining retrieval with LLM generation, but takes longer (2-3 seconds)

4. The system successfully demonstrates:
   - Direct graph queries returning structured data
   - Semantic search finding relevant text chunks
   - Natural language Q&A with contextual understanding

## Conclusion

The neo4j-graphrag-python library successfully provides multiple retrieval strategies:
- **For structured data queries**: Use Text2CypherRetriever
- **For document/chunk search**: Use HybridRetriever (faster than pure vector)
- **For conversational Q&A**: Use GraphRAG with any retriever

All components are working correctly with the SpyroSolutions semantic model and data.
