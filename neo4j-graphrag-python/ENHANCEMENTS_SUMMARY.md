# SpyroSolutions RAG System Enhancements Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Enhanced KG Builder with Entity Resolution ✅
**File**: `enhanced_kg_builder.py`

- Created an enhanced knowledge graph builder that extends SimpleKGPipeline
- Implemented entity resolution to automatically merge duplicate entities
- Added post-processing to clean up entity labels and properties
- Includes automatic index creation for performance

**Key Features**:
- Merges duplicate Customers, Products, and Teams based on name
- Preserves all relationships when merging entities
- Removes duplicate relationships between same nodes
- Fixes property naming inconsistencies (e.g., `cost` vs `amount`)

### 2. Custom Entity Extractor with Property Validation ✅
**File**: `custom_entity_extractor.py`

- Built a custom entity extractor with strict schema validation
- Validates all entity properties according to SpyroSolutions schema
- Automatically fixes common formatting issues

**Key Features**:
- Validates ARR format (e.g., $5M, $3.2M)
- Ensures scores are between 0-100
- Normalizes risk levels to High/Medium/Low
- Converts team sizes to integers
- Comprehensive error reporting

### 3. Post-processing to Merge Duplicate Entities ✅
**Integrated into**: `enhanced_kg_builder.py`

- Implemented as part of the EntityResolution class
- Automatically runs after knowledge graph creation
- Handles complex relationship transfers during merging

## Usage Examples

### Enhanced KG Builder
```python
from enhanced_kg_builder import EnhancedKGBuilder

# Initialize
builder = EnhancedKGBuilder(
    neo4j_uri="bolt://localhost:7687",
    neo4j_user="neo4j",
    neo4j_password="password123"
)

# Build from text
text = """
TechCorp Industries has an Enterprise Plus subscription worth $5M ARR.
The AI/ML Team with 30 engineers works on SpyroCloud Platform.
"""

result = await builder.build_from_text(text)
```

### Custom Entity Extractor
```python
from custom_entity_extractor import CustomEntityExtractor

# Initialize
extractor = CustomEntityExtractor()

# Extract entities with validation
result = await extractor.extract_entities(text)

# Result includes:
# - Validated entities with correct properties
# - Extracted relationships
# - Any validation errors
```

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Entity Resolution Pipeline
```
Text → SimpleKGPipeline → Initial Graph → Entity Resolution → Clean Graph
                                                ↓
                                         - Merge duplicates
                                         - Fix properties
                                         - Remove duplicate relationships
```

### 2. Validation Pipeline
```
Text → LLM Extraction → JSON Response → Property Validation → Fixed Entities
                                              ↓
                                     - Check required properties
                                     - Validate formats
                                     - Apply schema rules
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Quality**: Ensures consistent, validated entity properties
2. **Deduplication**: Automatically merges duplicate entities
3. **Performance**: Creates indexes for faster queries
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new entity types and validation rules
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation with detailed error messages

## Integration with Existing System

These enhancements integrate seamlessly with the existing SpyroSolutions RAG system:

- Works with both HybridRetriever and Text2CypherRetriever
- Compatible with the FastAPI endpoints
- Maintains the same Neo4j schema
- Enhances data quality without breaking existing functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment**:
   - Add batch processing for large documents
   - Implement incremental updates
   - Add monitoring and metrics

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - Entity disambiguation based on context
   - Temporal entity tracking
   - Confidence scoring for extracted entities

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Parallel processing for large texts
   - Caching for frequently accessed entities
   - Query optimization based on usage patterns
